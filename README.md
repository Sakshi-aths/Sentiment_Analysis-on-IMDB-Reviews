# Sentiment_Analysis-on-IMDB-Reviews
The application of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment in IMDb movie reviews is quite intriguing. IMDb is a famous platform where users can review and rate movies. In this context, sentiment analysis is an automated examination of such judgments to determine the mood or emotion exhibited by viewers.
Dataset
The dataset used for this sentiment analysis task is the IMDb movie reviews dataset. It contains 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 in the training set and 25,000 in the testing set. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative, making it suitable for a binary classification task.

Preprocessing
Before training the classification model, the following preprocessing steps were applied to the text data:

Text Cleaning: Removal of HTML tags, special characters, and punctuation.
Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
Text Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Stopword Removal: Eliminating common stop words that don't carry meaningful sentiment.
Padding and Sequence Truncation: Ensuring that all sequences have the same length by either padding or truncating.
Model Architecture
The sentiment classification model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It typically consists of the following layers:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into numerical embeddings.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Layers: These recurrent layers capture sequential dependencies in the text.
Dense Layers: One or more dense layers for classification.
Output Layer: A single output neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
Training
The model is trained on the training dataset using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The training process involves iterating over the training data for a fixed number of epochs while updating the model weights to minimize the loss.

Evaluation Metrics
To assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model, the following evaluation metrics are calculated on the test dataset:

Confusion Matrix: A table showing true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative values.
Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted samples to the total number of samples.
Precision: The ratio of true positives to the total predicted positives.
Recall: The ratio of true positives to the total actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance.
